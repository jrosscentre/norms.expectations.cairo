  The norms of a figure are the data that shows consistancy or relevance to the other peices of data whereas the exceptions are the peices of data that do not belong. In other words, the exceptions are the outliers to the set of data. The norms are going to yeild the most accurate best fit line for a set of data where an exception to the dat will cause the line to be less accurate. This causes for less accuracy when extrapolating and intropolating a set of data. These norms and exceptions can be easily identified in a set of data because of the pictoral representation. The norms will seem included in the figure where the norms will seem out of place.

  exceptions can help the reader of a figure see a certain peice of data better. If a set of data has a certain norm, the eye will be attracted to the commanality as the exceptions are highlighted. This can be good if a set of data's purpose is to draw attention to that peice or subset of data, but can also distract from the impact of the figure.
